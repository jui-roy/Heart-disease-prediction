# Heart-disease-prediction

   The prediction with ML models in identifying heart attack symptoms is highly efficient, especially with boosting algorithms. The prediction was done to evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the curve. ML models are being trained to perform optimized predictions.



Working on a heart disease prediction project which will be looking into the heart disease dataset. This dataset will derive various insights that help know the weightage of each feature and how they are interrelated to each other.
Here sole aim is to detect the probability of person who will be affected by a severe heart problem or not. This project will help reaching out interesting inferences from data to derive some meaningful results.

# Take away

The Heart Disease prediction will have the following key takeaways:

Data insight: As mentioned here we will be working with the heart disease detection dataset and we will be putting out interesting inferences from the data to derive some meaningful results.

EDA: Exploratory data analysis is the key step for getting meaningful results.

Feature engineering: After getting the insights from the data we have to alter the features so that they can move forward for the model building phase.

Model building: In this phase, we will be building our Machine learning model for heart disease detection.
